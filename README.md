# Pandas Challenge
The overall code was completed with the help of tutors booked through the tutoring services avaibale for bootcamp as well as using xpert learning assistant on canvas.

# Summary of Analysis
The analysis was done on the basis of bugdet spending per student, size of the school and the school type. Interestingly, the students passing with higher grade are from the range of minimal budget spending indicating those students are more focused on studies. The data summary for school size shows that schools with 2000 or higher number students, the score can be hugely diversified based on the diversity of students you have enrolled in your school. The chances are students scoring lower end are more populated compare to students who score higher. Last but not the least, studenst in charter school are doing very well overall in scoring Math and Reading. Also % of student passing Math and %overall passing in charter school are much higher compare to the % passiing students from district school. 
To conclude, schools with minimal budget spending per student, small to medium size with under 2000 students and charter schools are doing very well with respect to overll passing percentage.



# Two Conclusions

1. The average Math and Reading score is least impacted by the size of the school. For school which are larger in size, the average score lowered for both Math and Reading by few points only. The % of student passing Math and Reading falls down significantly though. But, the overall passing % has been hugely impacted, almost lowering by 42% for large size schools while the samll and medium size have maintained same % of overall passing rate.

1. In general, the charter school have students with higher avergae scores in Math and Reading compare to district school, although not significanltly high. But there is a significant difference in % of students passing Math and Reading. % of overall student passing in Math is 16% higher and % of overall student passing in reading is 37% higher for charter school than the district school.
